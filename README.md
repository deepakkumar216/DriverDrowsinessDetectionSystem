# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview
This project is aimed at developing a system that detects drowsiness in drivers in real-time to prevent accidents caused by fatigue. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze facial features and monitor the driver's state, triggering alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected.

## Features
- Real-time detection of driver drowsiness.
- Monitoring of facial features such as eye closure and head position.
- Customizable alert mechanisms (audio, visual, etc.).
- Lightweight and efficient implementation suitable for resource-constrained environments.
- Easy integration with existing vehicle systems.
